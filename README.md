This was a project worked during my NuCamp Coding Bootcamp.

It is a simple Hangman Game, displaying the hanged figure when you either lose by running out of guesses,
or trying to guess the word but guess incorrectly.
With each guessed letter you get 1 point. If you manage to guess the complete word, the total points you have accumulated will 
multiply by 2.
First start the game by typing: python hangman.py into your terminal. 
Second choose your difficulty level.
You will have 6 tries to guess the correct word.
